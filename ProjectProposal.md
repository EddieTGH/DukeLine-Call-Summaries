ChatGPT is way too general. It's good at providing information about general concepts, but it doesn't extensively accurately know about specific topic. The concept of this web application is to create a personalized GPT chatbot. The objective is to allow users to create and interact with their own personalized chatbot that understands their information. Preliminary design considerations: utilize a vectorized database to store each user's information. I don't anticipate there to be any challenges except integrating with ChatGPT's API and working with a vectorized database and connecting it with Ruby and React.
