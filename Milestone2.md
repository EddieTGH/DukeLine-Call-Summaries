# Milestone 2

## a. Making progress towards the final project. Database schema is done.
## b. App has a User table and a Reviews table. User's will also be able to sign in once the backend is implemented.
## c. Tables: Users, Reviews.
## d. Completely deviated in project goals (realized RAG was too dificult to implement):

## 1. To allow DukeLine coaches to submit call summaries about different clients
## 2. To allow DukeLine coaches to review a list of a client's past call summaries to gain more information about the client.
## 3. To provide security and ensure a client's privacy by only allowing DukeLine coaches to access the call summaries of their clients.

## e. Anticipated pages: Reviews, Create_Reviews, Update_Reviews, Sign_In, Sign_Up, Sign_Out.
## f. The demo video is the app as of Milestone 4, as I was unfortunately backlogged and am writing these milestones after making large progress on the app during Milestone 4 to estimate and document progress. Video Link: https://youtu.be/pt-aY6QcYpo
