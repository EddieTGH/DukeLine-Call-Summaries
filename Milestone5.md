# Milestone 5

## This app offers functionality by combining database interactions with frontend state management. For example, when a user logs in, the React frontend sends a request to the Ruby on Rails backend, which verifies the credentials against the PostgreSQL database. Once authenticated, the user can create a new review by filling out a form on the frontend. This data is then sent to the backend, saved in the database, and instantly reflected on the frontend without needing to refresh the page, thanks to Reactâ€™s state management.
## All 7 requirements are met. The additional feature is integration with OpenAI API LLM. 
## All 3 application goals are met.
## Demo video: 
## No blockers. Future work: improve the LLM API summary generation accuracy and relevance and productionize it to DukeLine
